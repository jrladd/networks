# Assignments

On this page you'll find prompts for the different assignments in our course, as well as a breakdown of assignments. Additional information about assignments and grading can be found on the [Course Policies](../course-info/course-policies.md) page.

Some of these assignments, especially Projects 2 & 3, will take the form of Jupyter notebook reports. You can refer to the [Criteria for Good Reports](../resources/criteria.md) as a guide.

You can also view the weekly homework assignments (see dropdown at left).

**All assignments will be turned in via Github Classroom. For this, you will need to set up a [Github](https://github.com/) account (with [Github Education](https://github.com/education/students) enabled, for extra features). Links to our Github Classroom assignments are on Sakai.**

*The homework assignments will be collected in one Github Classroom assignment repo that you will update throughout the semester. That link is also on Sakai.*
