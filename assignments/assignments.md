# Assignments

On this page you'll find prompts for the different assignments in our course, as well as a breakdown of assignments. Additional information about assignments and grading can be found on the [Course Policies](../course-info/course-policies.md) page.

Some of these assignments, especially Projects 2 & 3, will take the form of Jupyter notebook reports. You can refer to the [Criteria for Good Reports](../resources/criteria.md) as a guide.

You can also view the weekly homework assignments (see dropdown at left).
