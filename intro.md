# Network Analysis in Python

**by [John R. Ladd](https://jrladd.com)**

This short book is intended as a guide to working with networks in Python. It includes tutorials for working with NetworkX, Pandas, Altair, and other libraries.

Mainly, these tutorials are meant as a companion to [Advanced Data Analysis: Networks](/course-info/general-info.md), my course at Washington & Jefferson College. But they're general enough to be useful to anyone curious about how to include networks into a Python data science workflow.
