# Set Up Jupyter Lab

This page will help you make sure you are set up to use Python and Jupyter Lab on your own computer as well as in the classroom. You will use the Jupyter Notebook file `getting_started.ipynb` linked below and also available in the Python folder in the Resources tab to test that you are set up properly.

## Getting Set Up In The Classroom

Important Note: while we will be using the same software, Jupyter Lab, in both the classroom and on your own computer, you will start the applications in different ways depending on which system you are on. Specifically, in the classroom, you will use a Jupyter.bat file to launch the software. You SHOULD NOT put this file on your own computer. On your own computer, you will launch Anaconda and Jupyter Lab as you would any other application you have installed.

To use python in the classroom, we will use the Anaconda package already installed on these computers:

1. Create a folder in your share space (that is, your H: drive) with a name like "python" or "CIS397".
2. Download and save the getting_started.ipynb file linked above to that folder
3. Download the <a href="../resources/Jupyter.txt" download>Jupyter.txt</a> file linked here and save it to the desktop
4. Rename the `Jupyter.txt` file to `Jupyter.bat`
5. Double click the `Jupyter.bat` icon to launch Jupyter Lab
6. In the interface that appears, navigate to the folder you created with the `getting_started.ipynb` file in it
7. Click on the `getting_started.ipynb` file to open it; you should see a collection of Python code and markdown comments, broken up between a number of boxes/cells
8. Follow the instructions in the file to run the code and review the output

## Getting Set Up On Your Own Computer

To use python on your own computer, you will install Anaconda, available at https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

1. Download the Individual Edition installer for your system
2. Run the installer using the default/recommended options
3. Download the `getting_started.ipynb` file linked above, keeping track of where you have saved it on your computer
4. Launch the Jupyter Lab application; this may be inside an Anaconda3 folder or an Anaconda Navigator application
5. In the interface that appears, navigate through the directories/folders on your computer to the space where you have saved the getting_started.ipynb file.
6. Click on the getting_started.ipynb file to open it; you should see a collection of Python code and markdown comments, broken up between a number of boxes/cells
7. Follow the instructions in the file to run the code and review the output
