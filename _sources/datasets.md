# Where to Find Network Data

As we discussed in class, network data is all around us, any time there are links between entities to explore. That's all well and good, but where do you actually find network data when you need it?

This page includes a list of great resources for network data. Much of this data comes straight from real network researchers. You can use this page to find data for your projects, and much of the data for our in-class assignments comes from these same resources.

No matter where your data came from, **remember to always appropriately cite your sources**. Many of these datasets took a lot of work to compile and process!
