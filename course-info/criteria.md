# Criteria for Good Reports

In this course, you'll write data analysis reports in Jupyter notebooks, combining programming in Python with visualizations and written explanations. You'll turn in a report for many of the homeworks, and your two main projects will also take the form of Jupyter notebook reports.

Good data analysis requires the combination of clear writing, well-functioning code, and solid quantitative reasoning. You can follow this list of criteria for crafting good reports, and I'll use the same criteria when I assess your work.

- **Focus and Organization**: All questions in the report are answered and all required sections are complete. Report is organized and easy to follow.
- **Writing**: Writing is clear, with all visualization and statistical output explained completely, accurately, and in terms of the data.
- **Code**: Code sections are complete and all code runs without errors. Code is well-commented and easy to read.
- **Statistics & Analysis**: All analysis is accurate and given in context, both in terms of the data and of the relevant statistical concepts.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations are clear, accurate, and well-labeled. Good visualizations should be readable on their own but also well-explained in writing.

For more on what I'm looking for in the writing, visualization, and analysis portions of the reports, you can refer to the [How to Explain in CIS241](https://jrladd.com/CIS241/resources/how-to-explain) guide. (Even though it's not for our class, the general ideas are still relevant here.)
